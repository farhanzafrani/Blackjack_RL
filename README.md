# Blackjack_RL
I took part in a workshop on **Practical Reinforcement Learning** that NUST organized in collaboration with Coventry University Uk. It was 5 days long workshop in which `@Professor-James-Brucey` taught us the basis of Reinforcement learning and demonstrated a brief overview of how to use it for solving real-world applications.

In this workshop project, I implemented the Gymnasium library to use the environment of the Blackjack. For the training purpose, I used the Greedy Policy to learn the policy to take accurate action to win the game.
